excerpt: A simple exercise about bricks can change the way that you think forever.

Bricks are awesome! Since Ancient times, bricks have had unlimited potential. Everything from homes to mansions, shops to skyscrapers, and roads to runways exist because of bricks. They are one of the most important inventions in human history because they were the tools that people used to bring their ideas to life. Since the rise of the Internet and the commercial and residential development of the industrialized world, bricks have fallen out of favor. Phrases such as “brick and mortar” have become a way to call an institution outdated and not nearly as cool as its digital progeny. But could bricks have a second life? Could bricks be something more?

**Go Ahead Look at Go ahead. Look at this brick. What else could this single brick be used for? Take five minutes and think about it.**

**Don’t cheat! Set a timer for five minutes and see what you come up with!**

Welcome back! What did you come up with? 

#### Some of the most common answers are:

- Part of brick wall
- Paperweight
- Door stopper

#### Some common answers are that were seen as the most creative are:

- Weapon
- Pot to Grow Plants or Flowers in 
- Stabilization device for a piece of furniture

#### Another approach is to break apart the brick and use it for something else:
- Chop it in half
- Use it for martial arts or karate practice 
- Break it up and use it for pigament in an art project 


If you didn’t come up with these things it’s okay. The first time I did this exercise the same thing happened to me. I came up with something to put in a wall, weapon, paperweight, and imaginary friend (but that is for another time). I thought like this because I couldn’t get past seeing the brick as nothing more than a brick. I saw the brick as something that you make buildings walls and basically nothing else with right??? (hint: WRONG!)
This line of thinking couldn’t be more wrong. Falling into this line of thinking is an example of functional fixedness. Functional fixedness is the cognitive bias where individuals can only see things in terms of their traditional use. A brick could be anything if we are able to envision it to be anything.

A functionally fixed mindset limits our creative potential. Since creativity is a mental exercise — often called the highest form of human cognition — we need to make sure that we aren’t putting our minds into a tight limited box when we are trying to generate new ideas and come up with new innovative solutions to difficult problems.
Creativity is a muscle. You either train it to make it strong or you don’t use it and it atrophies and becomes weak. The only reason that things exist as they are today is because someone with the same creative abilities as you trained their creative muscles to conquer functional fixedness so they could see something for what it has the potential to be. You can do the same thing. You have the power to unlock your creative potential and change the world if you let yourself see the world for what it could be instead of what it traditionally is.

Some of the most innovative companies and the most innovative tools came into existence because they overcame functional fixedness. We have the Internet becuase we were able to imagine a new civilian and commercial purpose for an obscure government project that made computers communicate; we have Uber and Lyft because we were able to imagine cars as something you could use to get the world from Point A to Point B and not just your friends and family; we have cured numerous diseases by using observations to draw conclusions that showed that our traditional treatments were flawed and new innovative treatments were better; we even have bricks because we were able to see that when you dry and fire clay and water you have a tool to build anything that your heart desires.

Creativity is innate. All of the 7 billion plus people on the planet have the ability to create. If we train our brains to conquer functional fixedness, there is nothing that we won’t be able to achieve.

Happy creating!
